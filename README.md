## What is FFB-WordMerge?
*The answer is really easy!*

Do you need to merge some Word files and, **obviously**, you don't remember how to do it without thousands of *copy and paste* *copy and paste* *copy and paste*........?

**Don't worry!**

***FFB-WordMerge can do it for you in a couple of seconds!***

## Why "FFB"?
"FFB" stands for "*Fraternità Francescana di Betania*".

This simple program was created for a sister of the Fraternità Francescana di Betania that was working with a lot of ".docx" files, writing news and articles for the official website: www.ffbetania.net


Microsoft Words gives the possibility to merge doc files but it's not easy for everyone, especially if the person doesn't have computer experience or knowledge.

## But... A "word-merge" probably already exists!
I don't care. 
I only wanted to solve this problem.
...and this is my favorite way! 


**Enjoy this simple program, 100% Python!**
